    "## Explanation of Task\n",
    "This task is a classification problem designed to predict the degree of obesity based on given features (gender, age, height, weight, family history of obesity, smoking habitsï¼Œetc). The degree of obesity can be categorized into several levels, such as Insufficient_Weight,Normal_Weight,Overweight_Level_I ,Overweight_Level_II,Obesity_Type_I,Obesity_Type_II,Obesity_Type_III.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The business context of this task may lie in the healthcare sector, where doctors or health experts aim to assess the obesity risk of patients based on their features to develop personalized health management plans. Additionally, insurance companies might be interested as obesity can increase the risk of certain health issues, impacting insurance claim costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders interested in the results include healthcare providers, health insurance companies, and individuals interested in managing their health. The model could be deployed in healthcare institutions or insurance company systems to assist decision-making or provide personalized recommendations.\n"

    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "For this task, we would prepare our dataset by selecting relevant features such as gender, age, height, weight, family history of obesity, smoking habits,etc. We would encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding and apply preprocessing techniques like scaling to ensure all features are on a similar scale. We may remove variables that are not useful for the analysis, such as unique identifiers or variables with too many missing values. After preprocessing, we will have a final dataset ready for classification."

    "## Data Splitting\n",
    "We will split our dataset into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split, where 80% of the data will be used for training the model and 20% for testing its performance. This split is appropriate as it provides an adequate amount of data for training while still reserving a sizable portion for evaluation. With a larger training set, the model can learn more complex patterns in the data, leading to potentially better performance. However, it's essential to ensure that the testing set is representative of the overall data distribution to obtain reliable performance metrics."
